/**
 * This class may be used for coroutine sequencing in Java.
 * <p>
 * Coroutines are created as instances of <tt>Coroutine</tt>-derived
 * classes that override the abstract method <tt>body</tt>. 
 * The <tt>body</tt> method is used to specify their actions.
 * <p>
 * A coroutine may temporarily suspend its execution and another
 * coroutine may take over. A suspended coroutine may later
 * be resumed at the point where it was suspended.
 * <p> 
 * Resumption can be performed by one of
 * two operations, <tt>resume(c)</tt> and <tt>call(c)</tt>, where
 * <tt>c</tt> is a <tt>Coroutine</tt>-object.
 * <p> 
 * Both operations resumes <tt>c</tt> and supends the currently 
 * executing coroutine.
 * <p>
 * The <tt>call</tt> operation furthermore establishes the current
 * coroutine as <tt>c</tt>'s caller. 
 * Coroutine <tt>c</tt> is said to be <i>attached</i> to its caller.
 * <p>
 * A coroutine can relinquish control to its caller by means 
 * of the operation <tt>detach()</tt>.
 * This causes the caller to resume its execution from the point where 
 * it last left off.
