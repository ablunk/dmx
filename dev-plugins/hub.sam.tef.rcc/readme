RunCC Version 0.7, 2006-12-29

This is a library containing a parser generator that can
generate parsers at runtime, no source generation is required.
The syntax is written in an EBNF dialect, or embedded within
Java source. Please read

for further information.

The library
	runcc.jar
contains the compiled classes of the framework.

Source code and syntaxes are in directory
	src

Starting the library with
	java -jar runcc.jar '(1 + 2) / 3'
will display 1.0 (when everything is OK).


This library is published under the LGPL.
