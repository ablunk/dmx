{"name":"DMX","tagline":"Discrete-Event Simulation Modelling Framework with Extensibility","body":"### Welcome to the DMX information page\r\n\r\nDMX is a framework which facilitates iterative prototypical development of domain-specific simulation modelling languages and tools. It is developed as a set of Eclipse plugins running under Eclipse Version 4.4.\r\n\r\nThe following Eclipse plugins are required by DMX:\r\n- Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF),\r\n- [Xtend](http://www.eclipse.org/xtend) Version 2.4 or higher, [available from here](http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/download.html),\r\n- and an adapted version of Textual Editing Framework (TEF), available from [this Eclipse Update Site](http://github.com/ablunk/dmx/raw/master/dev-plugins/hub.sam.tef.updatesite).\r\n\r\nDMX is an academic project. We try to have a stable running version in the latest commit. However, there might be some things not working from time to time. The purpose is to show the principle working of the framework.\r\n\r\nIn order to use DMX, you should import its plugins into your own Eclipse workspace. The contents provided at GitHub are listed below.\r\n\r\n### Contents\r\n\r\n- The folder [dev-plugins](https://github.com/ablunk/dmx/tree/master/dev-plugins) contains the framework as a set of Eclipse plugins. These plugins should be imported into your Eclipse workspace.\r\n- The folder [runtime-plugins](https://github.com/ablunk/dmx/tree/master/runtime-plugins) contains an example project with a lot of [DMX models](https://github.com/ablunk/dmx/tree/master/runtime-plugins/Examples/src-dmx). The project should be imported into the workspace of a second running Eclipse initiated from the first one.\r\n  - The **State Machine Language (SML)** used in a paper which was presented at the [SDL Forum 2013](http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~magic/sdl2013/) (June 26-28) is available [here](https://github.com/ablunk/dmx/tree/master/runtime-plugins/Examples/src-dmx/sdl2013).\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [Workbench Overview](http://github.com/ablunk/dmx/raw/gh-pages/dmx-workbench.pdf)\r\n\r\n#### Papers\r\n\r\n- Blunk, A., Fischer, J.: [Prototyping SDL Extensions]().
