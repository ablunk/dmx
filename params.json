{"name":"DMX","tagline":"Discrete-Event Simulation Modelling Framework with Extensibility","body":"### Welcome to the DMX information page\r\n\r\nDMX is a framework which facilitates efficient development of domain-specific simulation modelling languages and tools. It is developed as a set of Eclipse plugins running under Eclipse Version 3.7 Indigo.\r\n\r\nThe following Eclipse plugins are required by DMX:\r\n- Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF),\r\n- [Acceleo](http://www.eclipse.org/acceleo/) Version 3.2 or higher, available from [this Eclipse Update Site](http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/m2t/acceleo/updates/releases/3.2),\r\n- and [Textual Editing Framework (TEF)](http://www.markus-scheidgen.de/software-projects/427-2/), available from [this Eclipse Update Site](http://tef.berlios.de/updatesite).\r\n\r\nDMX is an academic project. We try to have a stable running version in the latest commit. However, there might be some things not working from time to time. The purpose is to show the principle working of a framework which facilitates efficient development of domain-specific simulation modelling languages and tools.\r\n\r\nIn order to use DMX, you should import its plugins into your own Eclipse workspace. The contents provided at GitHub are listed below.\r\n\r\nContents\r\n--------\r\n\r\n- The folder **dev-plugins** contains the framework as a set of Eclipse plugins. These plugins should be imported into your Eclipse workspace.\r\n- The folder **runtime-plugins** contains an example Eclipse project, which is using the DMX plugins. The project should be imported into the workspace of a second running Eclipse initiated from the first one.\r\n  - The **State Machine Language (SML)** used in a paper which will be presented at the [SDL Forum 2013](http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~magic/sdl2013/) (June 26-28) is available [here](https://github.com/ablunk/dmx/tree/master/runtime-plugins/Examples/src-odemc/sdl2013).\r\n\r\nContact\r\n-------\r\nHaving trouble with DMX?
