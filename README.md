# Discrete-Event Simulation Modelling Framework with Extensibility

![dmx logo](logo-small.png "dmx logo")

DMX is an approach that allows to define a domain-specific language (DSL) for simulation modelling by extending a highly runtime efficient general-purpose simulation base language.

The approach consists of

1. the base language DBX,
2. a model editor that instantly supports extensions with syntax highlighting and content assistance,
3. a compiler for DBX models with extensions,
4. and a DBX model launcher.

The base language and the tooling are provided as a set of plugins for Eclipse.
